# Development and maintenance

## Run locally

From the repository root, run `python3 -m http.server 5500`, then open [localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500). Python 3 is only a development-server option; VS Code Live Server also works. Stop the server with Ctrl+C. No package installation or build is required to serve this checkout.

## Implementation and boundaries

Navigation tooltips are controlled entirely by CSS hover and focus selectors. Navigation targets currently use `href="#"`; they do not open separate pages.

## Make changes

Update link labels and matching tooltip IDs/`aria-describedby` values in `index.html`; edit positioning and transitions in `styles.css`.

## Source map

- [`index.html`](../index.html)
- [`styles.css`](../styles.css)

## Verification

No automated test command is provided by this repository. The following manual checks are a checklist, not a claim that browser QA has been completed.

1. Hover each link, then Tab through all links and confirm tooltips appear for keyboard focus.
2. Check clipping near screen edges and behavior with reduced motion.
3. Inspect the browser console and Network panel for missing assets or script errors; check keyboard access, phone width, and 200% zoom.

## Deployment

Serve the tracked HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and required assets from a static host, preserving relative paths and filename case. There is no application server or environment-variable configuration in this checkout. Verify the actual deployment URL, external resources, and the checks below after publishing. A repository existing on GitHub does not by itself prove Pages is enabled.

## Keep documentation current

Update the README and this guide when entry points, dependencies, behavior, or deployment steps change. Record commands actually run and distinguish them from pending manual checks.
